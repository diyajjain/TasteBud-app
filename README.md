# TasteBud

TasteBud is like a Beli, but for music. People want a fun, low-effort way to share what they're listening to and express their daily mood through music. 

## What is the MVP?

- Users can create a profile based on their music taste (favorite genres, artists, and moods)
- Each day, users can log their favorite song of the day (maybe with a note)
- Users can rank that song against other songs they have logged (like the Beli algorithm)
- Users can view a feed of others' logs based on taste similarity
- Later on, when the user base grows (we can add friends and followers and be able to only see theirs)

## Tech stack 

- backend (Flask or Django)
- database schema (SQL)
- frontend (React)
